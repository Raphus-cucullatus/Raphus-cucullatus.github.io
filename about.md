This is Fan Yang, a system software research engineer at a tech
company.  I'm broadly interested in Linux kernel, virtualization,
networks, and hardware-software co-designs.  These days, I'm working
on TCP offloading on our DPU (Data Processing Unit) platform for
data-center applications.

I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees in Software Engineering from
[Shanghai Jiao Tong University][SJTU], advised by Prof. [Haibo Chen][HB], 
at [Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems][IPADS]
(IPADS).
