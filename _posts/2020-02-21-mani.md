[mani.el][MANI] is a tiny [Man][MAN] page reader for Emacs.

### Why not `man.el` or `woman.el`

[man.el][MANEL] does not support viewing remote Man pages.  Recently
I've found myself programming frequently in a remote environment: a
remote machine (usually Linux), from a macOS laptop.  In this case, I
prefer seeing Man pages in that machine, e.g. Linux system calls
instead of BSD ones, and tools installed on servers not on my laptop.

One can manage [woman.el][WOMANEL] to find remote man page
file[^WOMANREMOTE], but **`woman.el` does not always parse
correctly.**  For example, "`woman ls`" produces the following
sequences in my machine:

    .Dd May 19, 2002
    .Dt LS 1
    .Os
    .Sh NAME
    .Nm ls
    .Nd list directory contents
    ...

### `mani.el` is a "just-work" Man page reader

1.  It invokes the `man` program to produce the content.  So if `man`
    works, `mani.el` works.

2.  It uses `process-file` to run the `man` program.  So it is
    "remote-aware".  If the current `default-directory` is a remote one,
    `man` is invoked in that remote machine.


### Limitations

`mani.el` is not any feature-rich like `man.el` and `woman.el`.  It
does not support navigation, completion, highlight, and caching
functionalities.  I find it just work, and am less-motivated to push
it further.
